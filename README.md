# No_Show_appointment_project
### Data exploration:
* Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree project.
* In this project I investigate a dataset called (No show appointments).

### Project Overview:
* In this project, I analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it.
I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

### Introduction:
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.
The main question we are trying to answer here is: What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
* And every patient has its own :  
   *  PatientId / Identification of a patient.
   * AppointmentID / Identification of each appointment.
   * Gender / Male or Female.
   * ScheduledDay /tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
   * AppointmentDay / The day of the appointment.
   * Age / How old the patient is in years.
   * Neighbourhood / the location of the hospital.
   * Scholarship / 1 for True, 0 for False,the patient has government medical support.
   * Hipertension / 1 for True, 0 for False.
   * Diabetes / 1 for True, 0 for False.
   * Alcoholism / if the patient is Alcoholism; 1 for True, 0 for False.
   * Handicap / number of disabilities a patient has.
   * SMS_received / 1 for True, 0 for False.
   * No-show / Yes or No, if the patient shows up = No, if he doesn't = Yes.

### Exploration questions:
* Is there a relationship between gender and show up?
* Does the age of patients affect why they are shown or not?
* Which neighborhood has the most no show rate?
*  Does the patient who has a scholarship show up or not?
* Does hypertension affect the patient's show up?
* Does diabetes affect the patient's show up?
* Does alcoholism affect the patient's show up?
* Does the handicap affect the patient's show up?
* Did the patients receiving sms keep their appointment?

### What do I need to install?
* Python libraries: (NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
* Jupyter.

### Statistical Analysis:
* Data Wrangling
    * First I gather the data we need to answer my question
    * Second we will assess our data to identify any problems in data's quality or structure.
    * Finally clean our data by modifying,replacing or removing data to ensure that our    dataset is of the highest quality.

* Data exploratory & Answering questions:
   * Exploring involves finding patterns.
   * visualizing relationships.
 
* Write conclusions & Limitations.
